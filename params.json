{"name":"Games","tagline":"game development experiments","body":"### Welcome to HHM Games Experiments :)\r\nI have added games me and my brother have been developing to play in our spare time. You will find different types of games from: \r\n* [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), [GW-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC), [QBASIC / QuickBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic), [DarkBASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkBASIC) to [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), ...\r\n* [Arcade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game), [Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game), ...\r\n\r\n### Bomberman / DynaBlaster\r\nWe enjoyed many hours playing [Dynablaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) in the mid-90' so we decided to create a death match for us. The last update was 0.6, what we called 0.6nobugs ;) in 12-Jan-2000 and was hosted at brinkster.\r\nIt was developed for a 320x200 resolution [mode13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h) as our first PC was a [PC1512](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512).\r\n![Game screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carloshm/games/master/ScreenShots/Bomber.png)\r\n* Game technique\r\n* How did we created it. At that time there were several [compilers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) that we were aware of: [DJGPP/DJGCC](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/), [Borland Turbo-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C) and [Watcom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcom_C/C%2B%2B_compiler). We had Turbo-C as our key dev environment, and use some libraries to managed graphics mode (implemented with [asembler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler))\r\nYou may find several other compilers at [wikipedia compiler list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers) or [compilers.net site](http://www.compilers.net/Dir/Free/Compilers/CCpp.htm). It didn't have music or sounds, as we focus on silent matches ;)\r\n* How to run it. The best place to run this game would be a DOS x86 environment such as [FreeDos](http://www.freedos.org/), [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.com/), [Boschs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/), [DosEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/), [Fake86](http://fake86.rubbermallet.org/). \r\n* Video\r\n* Next steps\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can find the authors at @carloshm ([carl0shm](https://twitter.com/carl0shm))","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
